Click the *Create Content* button in the top right.

Fill in the article's *Title*, *Body*, *Featured Image*, and *Excerpt*. The *Excerpt* is the preview text on an article's carousel tile.

Set the article's *Topics*. Topics are case-sensitive. As you start to type, a drop-down list shows existing topics you can choose.

NOTE: An article is only displayed if at least one CMS Collection rule matches the article.

Article visibility depends on Community Cloud configuration and CMS Collection rules. For example, a community could have a rule that articles tagged with the topic "News" will be displayed in the list of news articles.

Click the *Save Draft* button in the top right corner.

When the draft is saved the *Publish* button appears in the top right corner.

Click the *Publish* button to make the article visible in the collections where it matches the rules configured.

big warning: visibility of articles depends on Community Cloud configuration, including CMS Collection settings. with the default settings, creating a new article with no tags will not make that article visible anywhere. must add News tag.

topics are case-sensitive. "news" vs "News". drop-down list will help.

Publish makes it visible in the collections where it matches the rules configured.

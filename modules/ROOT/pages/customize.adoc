The https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=community_designer_overview.htm&type=5[Community Builder, role=external, window=blank] enables you to create a community with your desired brand identity, look and feel, and site structure by providing control over the community's components, themes, pages, and its general, theme, and SEO settings.

In the API Community Manager (ACM) Control Panel, the *Community Builder* shows your site for editing. The *Pages* list shows the pages included with ACM and the pages you have added, and enables you to select and edit each page. The included page *Home* is displayed by default.

The *Community Builder* interface contains the customization icons described here.

== Components

The *Components* lightning bolt icon displays the component palette, which includes Salesforce Community Cloud components and ACM-specific components. Each component can be dragged from the component palette to the current page. Selecting the component on the page shows its configuration options.

Detailed component information is available from the page xref:acm-lightning-components.adoc[ACM Lightning Components] and
the Salesforce Community Cloud https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=rss_component_reference_table.htm&type=5[Community Components, role=external, window=blank] documentation.

including paragraph, heading, and button text.

Refer to https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=community_builder_theme_customize.htm&type=5[Customize Your Community Theme, role=external, window=blank].

== Pages

The *Pages* icon, which resembles a bulleted list, shows the pages in the community to view and edit. The *Pages* menu also offers a *New Page* option.

A new page can be an *Object Page* or *Standard Page*. An *Object Page* is only used with Salesforce objects,
so use *Standard Page* when creating your custom community pages. You can start your standard page by choosing one of the preconfigured pages or making a *New Blank Page*.

To make a new blank page, select the layout, then enter the new page's *Name* and *URL*. Use the URL to make
links to the new page, including links in menus.

The new page is displayed with placeholders for content based on the layout.

Add your components, such as a *Headline* component in the page header, or an ACM Lightning component
such as an *ACM API Version Carousel*.

The *Pages* menu also shows the editable configuration properties for each page, which are described
in  https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=community_builder_manage_pages_overview.htm&type=5[Manage Your Communityâ€™s Pages and Their Properties in Community Builder, role=external, window=blank].

== Settings

The *Settings* gear icon offers the following parameters:

* https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=community_builder_general_settings.htm&type=5[General, role=external, window=blank]
* https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=community_builder_theme.htm&type=5[Theme, role=external, window=blank]
* *SEO*: Search Engine Optimization (SEO) features define what information can be indexed by external services
and discovered through online searches, and can increase traffic to your public community.

The structure of your API community is defined by your xref:customize.adoc[community pages],
the xref:acm-lightning-components.adoc[Lightning components] contained in each, and the links between them.
You can define your own site structure and user journeys throughout your API community with these
elements, tailored to your specific needs and desires.

A typical API community has the following site structure:

image::site-structure.png[API Community Manager site structure]

* Home page: Contains welcome information (*Rich Text* component or *HTML* component), selected APIs and API groups (xref:acm-lightning-components.adoc#api-carousel[API Carousel] component), news and announcements (*CMS Collection* component), and the main search bar (xref:acm-lightning-components.adoc#acm-search-box[ACM Search Box] component).
* Login page: Allows a member to log in to your community, or go to the registration page if they are not already a member (xref:acm-lightning-components.adoc#login-form[Login Form] component).
* Registration page: Allows a guest user to register as a member in your community (xref:acm-lightning-components.adoc#self-register[Self Register] component).
* Search results page: Shows results of searches in the community (xref:acm-lightning-components.adoc#acm-search-results[ACM Search Results] component).
+
Each search result links to the appropriate page based on the type of the element, such as a content article page, an API details page, or others.
* News list page: Contains a list of the different content articles, such as news or announcements (*CMS Collection* component).
* News detail page: Displays the full content of a specific content article (*CMS Single Item* component).

* API and API groups details page: Displays the documentation and technical content of an API or API group, including the API console and a way to request access to the API.

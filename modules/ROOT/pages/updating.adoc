To take advantage of new and improved functionality in your community, ensure you keep your instance up to date.

To update your API community:
1. Go to ACM administration
2. Open the *Package update installation link* on the same browser session (provided by your MuleSoft representative)
3. Verify the version number and name of the release
4. Select "Install for admins only" and click "Upgrade"

This starts the installation process. Once the upgrade finishes, you'll receive an email.

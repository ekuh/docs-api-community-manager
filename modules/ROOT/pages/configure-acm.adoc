Use these steps to configure API Community Manager (ACM).

NOTE: Installing, updating or configuring ACM must be done by a user account with the *System Administrator* profile in the ACM Salesforce organization.

NOTE: If your Anypoint Platform organization is https://docs.mulesoft.com/eu-control-plane/platform-access-eu[hosted in the EU region, role=external, window=_blank] you must replace all occurrences of the `anypoint.mulesoft.com` domain with `eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com` in all the steps in this section.

== Create and Authenticate the External Data Source [[create-and-authenticate-the-external-data-source]]

The external data source specifies how ACM components and data objects interact securely with your MuleSoft Anypoint organization.

=== Create a Connected App [[create-a-connected-app]]

You can perform this step either with the user interface or with an API call.

==== Create a Connected App with the User Interface [[create-a-connected-app-with-the-user-interface]]

To create a connected app with the user interface, in Anypoint Platform, navigate to *Access Management* -> *Applications* -> *Create New Application*, and provide this information.

. *Application Name*: Enter a name.
. *Redirect URIs*: This URL can be found in the Authentication Provider configuration. Navigate
to *Salesforce Setup* -> *Auth. Providers* -> *Anypoint* -> *Callback URL*.
. *User Grant Types*
.. *Authorization Code*: Checked.
.. *Refresh Token*: Checked.
.. *Full Access*: Checked.
.. *Background Access*: Checked.
. Click *Create Application*.

==== Create a Connected App with an API Call [[create-a-connected-app-with-an-api-call]]

To create a connected app with an API call, follow this example using `cURL`.

Get an authorization token from the platform:

----
    curl --silent https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login -XPOST \
      -d 'username=<anypoint username>&password=<anypoint password>'
----

This returns a response like this:

----
    {
      "access_token": "5242XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXfec7",
      "token_type": "bearer",
      "redirectUrl": "/home/"
    }
----

Note the `access_token` value.

Use the next `cURL` example to register an external client in Anypoint for OpenID authentication.

Replace the access token in the authorization header with the `access_token` value.

Replace `[YourOrgDomain]` with your Salesforce organization domain name. Find the domain name by logging in to your Salesforce organization, clicking *Setup*, and clicking the section *My Domain*.

----
    curl -X POST \
      https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/api/connectedApplications \
      -H 'Accept: */*' \
      -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer 5242XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXfec7' \
      -H 'Host:anypoint.mulesoft.com' \
      -d '{"client_name":"SalesforceApp","grant_types":["authorization_code","refresh_token"],"redirect_uris":["https://[YourOrgDomain].my.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/Anypoint"],"scopes":["full","offline_access"],"public_keys":[]}'
----

The `cURL` command will return a response like this:

----
    {
      "client_id": "5fafXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX29c9",
      "client_secret": "9509XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXC10E",
      "client_name": "ACM Integration Client",
      "redirect_uris": [
        "https://[YourOrgDomain].my.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/Anypoint"
      ],
      "grant_types": [
        "authorization_code",
        "refresh_token"
      ],
      "public_keys": [],
      "scopes": [
        "offline_access",
        "full"
      ],
      "enabled": true,
      "owner_org_id": "f377XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXX9d08",
      "as_id": "anypoint"
    }
----

Note the `client_id` and `client_secret` values.

=== Create Your Authentication Provider [[create-your-authentication-provider]]

. Set the *Token Endpoint URL* to `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/api/v2/oauth2/token+` .
. Set the *Default Scopes* to `full offline_access`.
. Click *Save*.

NOTE: Remember to associate the external data source with this authentication provider.

paste `0052D000001QpG1` in the *Approver Id* field.

== Set Up User Impersonation [[set-up-user-impersonation]]

Impersonation links each community member to an Anypoint user. This connects the
Anypoint and community users and their client applications, so that applications are
created under the correct user, and actions in audit logs are recorded accurately.

Impersonation uses SAML, and it requires an Identity Provider (IdP) to be configured in both Anypoint Platform and Salesforce organizations. You can use Salesforce as an IdP, as described here.

=== Configure Salesforce as a SAML Identity Provider [[configure-salesforce-as-a-saml-identity-provider]]

To set up SAML in your Salesforce organization:

. In *Setup*, search for *App Manager* using the *Quick Find* box and click *App Manager*.
. Click *New Connected App* in the top right.
. Provide this information in the *Basic Information* section.

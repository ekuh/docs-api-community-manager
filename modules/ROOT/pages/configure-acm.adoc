To authorize and authenticate your External Data Source:

. Verify the Exchange *External Data Sources* *Authentication Status* is *Authenticated*.

After authenticating the External Data Source, provide the credentials of an Anypoint Platform system user with read-only access, for components like the API Console which retrieve data directly from the Anypoint Platform APIs:

. Search for *Named Credentials* in the *Quick Find* box and then select *Named Credentials*.

      https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/api/connectedApplications \
      -H 'Accept: */*' \
      -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer ***token***' \
      -H 'Host:anypoint.mulesoft.com' \
      -d '{"client_name":"SalesforceApp","grant_types":["authorization_code","refresh_token"],"redirect_uris":["https://OrgDomain.my.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/Anypoint"],"scopes":["full","offline_access"],"public_keys":[]}`

Developers can use the API Community Manager forums to share tips and advice on using the organization's APIs.

Your organization's community operator can moderate the forums. This includes replying to new discussions and questions, reviewing audit trails, and creating and managing forum rules. These rules can filter posts, other content, and members based on criteria defined by the operator. Members matching the criteria can be frozen, and posts and other content matching the criteria can be flagged, blocked, automatically edited to remove banned terms, or held for the operator to review them.

One simple and commonly used example of forum moderation is reviewing pending forum posts.

To approve or delete pending forum posts, select the *Manage Communities* tab. Click the *Workspace* icon. Select *Moderation*.

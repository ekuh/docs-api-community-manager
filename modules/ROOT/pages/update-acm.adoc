Keep your Anypoint API Community Manager instance up to date to take advantage of new and improved functionality in your community.

For information about updates, see xref:notifications.adoc[Important Notifications].

After you install an update with this process, it is not possible to undo the installation and return to a previous version. We recommend installing updates with this best practice workflow:

. Create a developer sandbox.
. Install the update in the developer sandbox and test it.
. Discard the developer sandbox.
. Keep a partial copy sandbox or a full copy sandbox as a staging environment.
. Install the update in the staging sandbox and test it.
. Install the update in your production environment.

To update your API community:

. Open the API Community Manager control panel.
. In the same browser session, open the *package update installation link* provided by your MuleSoft representative.
. Verify the version number and name of the release.
. If you are upgrading from a package version before 1.26, follow these steps:
.. Go to Salesforce Workbench: https://workbench.developerforce.com/
.. Select Standard.
.. Enter your username and password.
.. Click the Login button.
.. In the Queries menu, click SOQL Query.
.. In the Object list, select *NavigationLinkSet*.
.. In the Fields list, select *Id* and *MasterLabel*.
.. Click the Query button.
.. The query results are displayed as a list of records.
.. Find the records with the *MasterLabel* field set to *NTO_Nav0* and *acm_template_Nav0*.
.. Click the *Id* of the record with the *MasterLabel* field *NTO_Nav0*.
.. Click the Delete button.
.. Click the Confirm delete button.
.. Click the *Id* of the record with the *MasterLabel* field *acm_template_Nav0*.
.. Click the Delete button.
.. Click the Confirm delete button.
.. Continue with normal package installation.
. Select *Install for admins only*.
. Select *Upgrade*.

This starts the installation process.

When the upgrade finishes, you receive a notification email.

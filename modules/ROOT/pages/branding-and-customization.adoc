of community pages and specify a different page for customization.

The Community Builder interface contains customization icons as described in the following sections. 

== Components

Select the *Components* lightning bolt icon in the top left navigation to display the component palette. 
The component palette includes Salesforce Community Cloud and ACM-specific components. 
Drag and drop the desired components from the component palette to the community page. Each 
component has its own configuration options that you can then access by selecting the component on the page.

For additional component information, refer to the https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=rss_component_koa_kokua_components.htm&type=5[Salesforce Community Cloud]

from the *Page* drop-down menu.
** *Publicly available*: Specifies whether the item is visible to the public or only to users who are logged in.
* *CMS Collection*: Displays content articles and allows you to organize them into Collections. Refer

including paragraph, heading, and button text.

for additional information.

== Pages

Select the *Pages* icon, which resembles a bulleted list, in the top left navigation to display the name of the current 
page or select another page in the community to view and edit. The *Pages* menu also offers a *New Page* option.

A new page can be an *Object Page* or *Standard Page*. An *Object Page* is only used with Salesforce objects, 
so use *Standard Page* when creating your custom community pages. You can start your standard page by choosing one of the preconfigured pages or making a *New Blank Page*.

To make a new blank page, select the layout, then enter the new page's *Name* and *URL*. Use the URL to make 
links to the new page, including links in menus.

The new page is displayed with placeholders for content based on the layout.

Add your components, such as a *Headline* component in the page header, or an ACM Lightning component 
such as an *ACM API Version Carousel*.

The *Pages* menu also shows the editable configuration properties for each page, which are described 
in  https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=community_builder_manage_pages_overview.htm&type=5[Manage Your Communityâ€™s Pages and Their Properties in Community Builder].

== Settings

Select the *Settings* gear icon in the top left navigation to access the following parameters:

* *General*: These settings include *Community Title*, *Public Access* to make the page public, and *Topics* 
that define the structure of the site, such as *Navigational Topics* and *Featured Topics*. Topics are a 
mechanism to organize content such as CMS articles and forum posts.
* *Theme*: Displays the *Theme* menu.
* *SEO*: Search Engine Optimization (SEO) features define what information can be indexed by external services 
and discovered through online searches, and can increase traffic to your public community.

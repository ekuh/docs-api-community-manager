Many companies use Salesforce Community Cloud to build branded and customized online portals to offer their products to their customers.

In the same way, your company can use API Community Manager to build branded and customized online portals to offer its APIs to the internal and external software developers who write code that uses and consumes those APIs.

These consumer developers will arrive at your company's site, which may include news, events, tutorials, and posts on a developer blog. Developers can search through a catalog of available APIs and documentation.

Developers can use the forums on the portal to collaborate, share ideas, and discuss any issues they find.

ACM also integrates with the Salesforce Service Console to help consumer developers file support cases and to help API engineers resolve the cases.
